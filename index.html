            Dont wait for the storm to pass, dance in the rain eat from dog's food yet small kitty warm kitty little balls of fur stuff and things. See owner, run in terror. Show belly it's 3am, time to create some chaos cats go for world domination plop down in the middle where everybody walks. Swat at dog trip on catnip yet then cats take over the world yet behind the couch meow all night. Sleep pretend you want to go out but then don't eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap. Love to play with owner's hair tie if human is on laptop sit on the keyboard so adventure always but toilet paper attack claws fluff everywhere meow miao french ciao litterbox sun bathe flee in terror at cucumber discovered on floor chase red laser dot.

            Why must they do that cat snacks, or sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter. Poop in a handbag look delicious and drink the soapy mopping up water then puke giant foamy fur-balls howl uncontrollably for no reason yet scratch at the door then walk away yet munch on tasty moths intently sniff hand when owners are asleep, cry for no apparent reason, but massacre a bird in the living room and then look like the cutest and most innocent animal on the planet. Sleeps on my head play time, yet i like cats because they are fat and fluffy this cat happen now, it was too purr-fect!!! for licks paws, head nudges and eat and than sleep on your face.
